![[observability.png]]Includes traces, logs, events, metrics - the four pillars of observability. 

Purpose is to understand the internal state of a system. 

Blackbox/whitebox monitoring.
Identify trends/outliers
Instrumentation, correlation, computation.
Identify bottlenecks and patterns. 
Measure and access performance of applications. 

## Metrics 
Numeric representation of data measured over intervals of time.
Suitable for triggering alerts/alarms.

## Events

An immutable timestamp record of discrete events that happened over time. 

## Logs
Not much useful in tracking code execution. They lack context in what they were called from. 

## Traces
Used to understand how different services connect together and how the requests flow through them.
