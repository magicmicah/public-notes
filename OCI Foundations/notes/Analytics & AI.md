## Data Integration
Native cloud service that helps with extract, transform, load (ETL)

Powered by Spark ETL. Graphical code free designer. 

Ingest data from files, databases, avro. 

Register data assets 

No code, drag and drop. Once the data is cleaned you can then pipe it to Oracle Autonomous database, MySQL or a Data Lake

## Data Flow
Apache spark applications, focus on applications and easy runtime environment.

Fully managed OCI service and no administration overhead. 

Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine with modules for streaming, ML, graph processing. Only framework that combines data and AI. 

Serverless data flow analyzes data from OCI Object Store to ADW to third party RDBMS

Import/run existing spark apps from EMR, databricks or Hadoop.

### Data Flow Concepts

User is a spark app that uses the spark api to perform data processing tasks. Anyone can reuse the app, write once, run hundreds of times.

Library central repository for data flow apps. run manage and search apps.

Runs - every execution is a run, scales on the fly, securely captures output. 

Administrator control - access policies, usage limits

Infrastructure - uses elastic compute/storage. Fully managed serverless offering and no administration overhead

Security - uses OCI IAM

## Data Catalog

Metadata management service that helps data professionals manage data and provide governance.

Service that gives you self service data discovery.

Value adds for data management tools, analytics, data science, data integrator.

Harvester - automate and manage harvesting jobs from wide range of sources into a common vocabulary with categories, subcategories and terms.

Then data can be searched, browsed or explored using the data catalog in the data asset Inventory.

Integrate using REST API and SDKs.

## Data Science

Rapidly train and deploy ML models using Oracle Cloud infrastructure.

Provides a collaborative project driven workspace. Enables self service for data science workloads.

Integration with the rest of the OCI stack, including functions, data flow, ADW and Object Storage.

Open Source supported for JupyterLab, KEras, xgboost, Tensforflow. 

### Data Science Concepts

Projects - collaborative workspaces to centralize, organize and document a team's work.

Notebook - sessions with pre isntalled libraries for python analyses and model development (Jupyter labs)

Models - Model to deliver business value. Track model metadata, save model artifacts, load into notebooks for testing.

Accelerated Data Science - Python library SDK to make common data science tasks faster, easier and less error prone.
