# public-notes

## What is this?

I have started a new habit where I write notes on things I am learning.  I am using Obsidian as my main note app and I am using git as a repository to store the notes.

## Why public git?

Why not? I consider it has more benefits than drawbacks. Number one - these notes are just random and related to different things I am learning. They may help others in their learning or they may provoke conversation. I consider it all a win.
