Oracles do not give clear answers because interpretation is open to the one receiving the advice. 

"Is there anyone wiser than Socrates?"
Rather than get a cryptic answer, they get "No. There's no human being wiser than Socrates."

We all carry confirmation bias that prevents us from seeing ourselves as we are. If we receive good compliments, we are self congratulatory because we believe we have above average intelligence.

Socrates response to the oracle is to challenge it. The gods represent moral exemplars, ways in which we can transcend and improve. The oracles' had a motto "know thyself" inscribed into the temple of Apollo of Delphi. Know thyself means not to know who, when, what you are but how you are - how you operate, think, etc. 

How can Socrates be the wisest human being when the very core of his thinking is that he cannot be the the wisest human being. From this he would ask people, via the socratic method, to find out more on how he could possibly be the wisest.

Thales had these ideas that were the beginnings of scientific understanding
"all is the moist" - everything is made of water
	The goal was to try and figure out the underlying substance that binds everything
"the loadstone has psyche"
	Reference to magnets, self moving like humans, psyche is the most self moving part of humans as its what drives everything to move
"everything is filled with gods"

Rhetoric is invented to use language in a way to change others minds. The sophists would use this to convince aristocrats on various issues up for vote. Sophists picked up that what we find salient is what shapes how we see things and understand then, no matter if its true or not.

Rhetoric is heavily used in advertising, politics and all sorts of areas where minds need to be convinced of something. 

Sophistry is bullshit. See "On Bullshit" by Harry Frankfort. Bullshit, unlike lying, has you uninterested in what is true. Lying tries to convince you of the truth. Bullshit is trying to capture the salience of the idea, whether its true or not. 

Example is Kang's twirling twirling twirling towards freedom speech in the Simpsons. The people are so enthralled with the rhetoric, the idea, that they ignore it makes no sense.

Self deception does not work. While you cannot lie to yourself, you can bullshit yourself. You can redirect your attention to the things that are not true. Paying attention to something makes it salient. Attention can be directed or captured.

You can direct your attention towards something and it will seem salient and because it is salient it will capture your attention. The more you you pay attention, the more it becomes salient. The more it becomes salient, the more it captures your attention. You lose the capacity to pay attention to other things and this is how you can bullshit yourself.

Sophists gained the ability to gain relevance without truth. Socrates wanted relevance with truth and in that truth they would find salience. This is how Socrates would question people incessantly to get to the truth of what they are doing and they would get to this point of aporia where they could no longer answer.

Getting to this point provokes a reaction, anger/annoyance or insight where the person realizes they need to keep relevance and truth tracking each other. Through this Socrates was able to say that "he knew what he did not know".

Through Socrates trial, he is trying to be convinced to stop spreading his ideas of philosophy and in response to this he says "the unexamined life is not worth living". A life where there is no effort to understand the meaning in life is full of bullshit. 

Ta erotika means how to love well, knows what to care about. Socrates knows to care about the things that are real. Spending 20 minutes on hair vs 20 minutes on fixing yourself. Cultivating wisdom. 

Socrates narrowly loses his trial. The accusers propose death. Plato is present at his trial but is not present at his death. Plato will take Pythagoras and Socrates philosophies and merge them together into something new.
